### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a physics student at the University of Pisa, with a passion for all kinds of science and technology. In my free time, I'm an avid CTF player and member of the fibonhack team, where I sharpen my problem-solving skills and explore new challenges.

On my page, you'll find a collection of repositories that showcase my coding skills and interests. From physics simulations to ctfs challenge, I'm constantly exploring new technologies and building innovative solutions.
