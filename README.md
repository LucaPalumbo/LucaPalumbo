### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a physics student at the University of Pisa, with a passion for all kinds of science and technology. In my free time, I'm an avid CTF player and member of the Fibonhack team, where I sharpen my problem-solving skills and explore new challenges.

On my page, you'll find a collection of repositories that showcase my coding skills and interests. From physics simulations to games development, I'm constantly exploring new technologies and building innovative solutions. 

I'm always open to collaborating with others, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together.
